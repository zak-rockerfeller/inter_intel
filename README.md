<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project is a Flutter and Laravel application that demonstrates the use of an actionbar, bottom navigation bar, and several screens for displaying information. The menu items in the bottom navigation bar include "info", "design", "response", and "dictionary", and when clicked, they open respective screens that update the actionbar title with a back button on the actionbar. The initial screen is the "info" screen.


<h3>Features</h3>
Actionbar and bottom navigation bar with menu items
Transitions and animations between screens
An impressive splash screen
A form on the "info" screen that captures a user's basic information (name, email, phone number) and a submit button.
A user profile card that is created on the "design" screen when the submit button is clicked and automatically navigates to that screen for the user to view.
Custom widgets on the "design" screen to showcase UI and UX skills
Networking call to the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_limit=5 API on the "response" screen to display a list of todos indicating the title and completed value.
Sorting of a dictionary/array on the "dictionary" screen, where numeric keys are sorted in ascending order and alpha keys are sorted in ASCII ascending order, and displayed in key:value format on a card or any other display widget.


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
