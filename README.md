<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project is a Flutter and Laravel application that demonstrates the use of an actionbar, bottom navigation bar, and several screens for displaying information. The menu items in the bottom navigation bar include "info", "design", "response", and "dictionary", and when clicked, they open respective screens that update the actionbar title with a back button on the actionbar. The initial screen is the "info" screen.
